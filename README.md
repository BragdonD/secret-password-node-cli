# Secret Password Hashing

This is a simple Node.js script that demonstrates how to securely ask a user in the console with readline-sync and then use this input as a password.

##  Prerequisites
Make sure you have the following software installed on your system:
- Node.js: https://nodejs.org
- pnpm

## Installation
````bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/secret-password-hashing.git
cd secret-password-hashing
pnpm install
````
## Usage
````bash
pnpm run prepare
pnpm run generate
````
Follow the prompts and enter your desired password when prompted.
The script will securely hash the password using bcrypt and display the resulting hashed password in the console.
